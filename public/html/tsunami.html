        <h2>What is a Tsunami</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = content>

    
        <p>A tsunami is a series of enormous waves caused by large-scale disturbances 
            in or near oceans, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater 
            landslides, or meteorite impacts. These waves can travel across entire 
            ocean basins at high speeds, causing widespread damage when they reach 
            coastal areas. The average height of a tsunami is 100ft above sea level. The tallest tsunami occured in 1958 in Alaska, where it reached an initial height of 1700ft. The term "tsunami" originates from Japanese, with "tsu" meaning "harbor" and "nami" meaning "wave."</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = "content">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Seismic Activity</b></li>
        <p>The most common cause of tsunamis is undersea earthquakes, often resulting from tectonic plate movements. When an earthquake occurs, it can displace large volumes of water, creating waves that spread out in all directions.This occurs when the tectonic plates shift, which causes a great amount of water to be shifted and lead to a tsunami.</p>
        <li><b>Volcanic Eruptions</b></li>
        <p>Eruption near the ocean can displace a great amount of water, leading to a tsunami</p>
        <li><b>Meteor</b></li>
        <p>Although rarer than the other causes, a metor can lead to a tsunami. When a meteor of a great size falls into the ocean, lots of water becomes displaced. These waves continue to grow until they reach the mainland.</p>
    </ul>

    <div class = header>
        <h2>What to do in the event</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = content>

    
    <p><b>Immediate Action: </b>If you feel a large earthquake and are near the coastline,
       dont wait for an official warning. If you are in a boat on the ocean, 
       move to deeper water if possible.  Tsunamis are less dangerous in deep ocean, 
       where their energy spreads over a larger area, reducing the height and force of the waves.</p>

    <p><b>Seek High Ground: </b> The higher you can get, the better. If you're in a building 
      and can't evacuate to higher ground, go to the highest floor. Avoid basements or 
      lower-level areas that could flood.</p>

    <p> <b>Areas to avoid: </b> Avoid coastal areas if possible. Tsunamis can come
       in multiple waves, so even after the first wave stay away. 
       Also stay away from inland bodies of water connected to the ocean, 
       as they can travel through these.  </p>

    <p><b>After the Tsunami:</b> After the Tsunami hits, don't return to 
      evacuated locations until authorities confirm it's safe. Further waves 
      or aftershocks can cause additional tsunamis. Be cautious of downed power 
      lines, unstable structures, or other hazards. Continue to listen to emergency 
      broadcasts for updates and safety info</p>
