<div class="content">
    <p class="paragraph">In the event of an earthquake, there are many things that you may need to help you survive. Below is a checklist that you can use to make sure that you are prepared and have the supplies you need. If you do not have some of these items and are in an area that is at risk for earthquakes, consider stocking up to be prepared.</p>

<!--
    The following is a checklist for items/plans for an earthquake
-->

<div class="header"><h2>CHECKLIST</h2></div>
<div class="content">

    <input type="checkbox" id="item1" name="item1" value="EmergencyKit">
    <label for="item1">Emergency kit with essential supplies</label><br>
    <p>This is a catch-all for any other important supplies you may need in the event of an earthquake.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item2" name="item2" value="Flashlights">
    <label for="item2">Flashlights and extra batteries</label><br>
    <p>Since earthquakes can disrupt power lines, you may be left without power. Flashlights allow you to see if the power goes out.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item3" name="item3" value="FirstAidKit">
    <label for="item3">First aid kit</label><br>
    <p>As with many disasters, there is a high chance that someone will get injured. Securing a first aid kit is a must-have to disinfect, bandage, and clean injuries.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item4" name="item4" value="FoodWater">
    <label for="item4">Emergency food and water supply</label><br>
    <p>Since the power may be out for long periods of time, you will need a good supply of food and water. You will want to get non-perishable food such as canned goods so you can keep them in your kit for long periods of time.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item5" name="item5" value="PortableRadio">
    <label for="item5">Portable radio</label><br>
    <p>The government may issue emergency reports and information in the days after the earthquake, so a portable radio will allow you to keep up with the current news.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item6" name="item6" value="ClothingBlankets">
    <label for="item6">Extra clothing and blankets</label><br>
    <p>Without power, the nights may be cold. Keeping extra blankets and clothes will help you stay warm.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item7" name="item7" value="Medications">
    <label for="item7">Medications and medical supplies</label><br>
    <p>If anyone in your family requires medication, you should keep an emergency stash in case of an emergency. You also need to keep Tylenol and Advil in this kit.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item8" name="item8" value="FamilyPlan">
    <label for="item8">Family emergency plan</label><br>
    <p>If you and your family get separated during an earthquake, it is essential to have an emergency plan and a place to meet in case you get separated.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item9" name="item9" value="EvacuationRoutes">
    <label for="item9">Learn evacuation routes and shelter locations</label><br>
    <p>Knowing the evacuation routes and nearest shelter locations can save crucial time during an emergency.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="item10" name="item10" value="CashDocuments">
    <label for="item10">Cash and important documents</label><br>
    <p>Since the power will most likely be out, many places will not be able to take debit or credit cards. Having emergency cash will allow you to make purchases for whatever you need.</p>
