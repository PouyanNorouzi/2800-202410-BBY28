        <h2>What is an Earthquake</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = content>

    
        <p>An earthquake is a sudden and violent shaking
            of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic
            plates beneath the Earth's surface. This movement
            releases energy in the form of seismic waves, which
            radiate outward from the point of origin, called the
            hypocenter or focus. The intensity of an earthquake can
            vary widely, ranging from barely perceptible tremors to
            catastrophic events that cause extensive damage and loss
            of life. Earthquakes can occur along fault lines, where
            tectonic plates meet, or can be triggered by volcanic activity
            or human-induced actions.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = "content">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Movement of Tectonic Plates</b></li>
        <p>Earthquakes result from the shifting and grinding of Earth's tectonic plates, releasing stored energy.</p>
        <li><b>Volcanic Eruptions</b></li>
        <p>Magma movement during volcanic activity can fracture rocks, generating seismic waves and causing earthquakes.</p>
        <li><b>Underground Explosions</b></li>
        <p>Human activities like mining or explosions can induce seismic events by creating vibrations that propagate through the Earth.</p>
        <li><b>Induced Quaking</b></li>
        <p>Human actions like fracking or injecting fluids underground can alter crustal stress, potentially causing earthquakes.</p>
    </ul>

        <h2>What to do in the event</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = content>

    
    <p><b>Drop, Cover, and Hold On:</b> If you're indoors,
         drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of
        furniture or against an interior wall, and hold on
        until the shaking stops. If you're outside, move to an open
        area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires,
        and drop to the ground.</p>

    <p><b>Stay Indoors Until Shaking Stops:</b> Even after the shaking stops,
        remain indoors until it is safe to exit. Aftershocks can occur minutes,
        hours, or even days after the initial quake.</p>

    <p> <b>Be Prepared:</b> Keep an emergency kit with essential supplies such as water,
         food, a first-aid kit, flashlight,
         and batteries in an easily accessible location.</p>

    <p><b>Listen to Authorities:</b> Follow instructions from local authorities and emergency services.
         They will provide information on any necessary evacuations or safety measures.</p>
