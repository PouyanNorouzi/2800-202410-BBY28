    <div class = content>

    
        <p>A tsunami is a series of enormous waves caused by large-scale disturbances 
            in or near oceans, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater 
            landslides, or meteorite impacts. These waves can travel across entire 
            ocean basins at high speeds, causing widespread damage when they reach 
            coastal areas. The average height of a tsunami is 100ft above sea level. The tallest tsunami occured in 1958 in Alaska, where it reached an initial height of 1700ft. The term "tsunami" originates from Japanese, with "tsu" meaning "harbor" and "nami" meaning "wave."</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Seismic Activity</li>
        <p>The most common cause of tsunamis is undersea earthquakes, often resulting from tectonic plate movements. When an earthquake occurs, it can displace large volumes of water, creating waves that spread out in all directions.This occurs when the tectonic plates shift, which causes a great amount of water to be shifted and lead to a tsunami.</p>
        <li>Volcanic Eruptions</li>
        <p>Eruption near the ocean can displace a great amount of water, leading to a tsunami</p>
        <li>Meteor</li>
        <p>Although rarer than the other causes, a metor can lead to a tsunami. When a meteor of a great size falls into the ocean, lots of water becoems displaced. These waves continue to grow until they reach the mainland.</p>
