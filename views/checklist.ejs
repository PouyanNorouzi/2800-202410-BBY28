    <h1>DISASTER CHECKLIST</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In the event of a disaster, there are many things that you may need to help you survive.
            Below is a checklist that you can use to make sure that you are prepared and have the supplies you need in
            any disaster. If you do not have some of these items and are in an area that is at risk for tsunamis,
            consider stocking up to be prepared.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The following is a checklist for items/plans for a disaster -->

    <div class=header>
        <h2>CHECKLIST</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <form action="/checklistSave" method="post" id="checklistForm" savedChecklist="<%=savedChecklist%>">
            <input type="checkbox" id="item0" name="item0" value="Emergency kit with essential supplies">
            <label for="item0">Emergency kit with essential supplies</label><br>

            <p>This is a catch-all for any other important supplies you may need in the event of a disaster</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="item1" name="item1" value="Flashlights and extra batteries">
            <label for="item1">Flashlights and extra batteries</label><br>

            <p> Since disasters can knock over power lines, you may be left without power. Flashlights allow you to see
                if
                the power goes out.</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="item2" name="item2" value="First aid kit">
            <label for="item2">First aid kit</label><br>

            <p>As with many disasters, there is a high chance that someone will get injured. Securing a first aid kit is
                a
                must have to disinfect, bandage, and clean injuries.</p>


            <input type="checkbox" id="item3" name="item3" value="Emergency food and water supply">
            <label for="item3">Emergency food and water supply</label><br>

            <p> Since the power may be out for long periods of time, you will need a good supply of food and water. You
                will
                want to get non-perishable food such as canned goods so you can keep them in your kit for long periods
                of
                time</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="item4" name="item4" value="Portable radio">
            <label for="item4">Portable radio</label><br>

            <p> The government may issue emergency reports and information in the days after the disaster, so a portable
                radio will allow you to keep up with the current news</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="item5" name="item5" value="Extra clothing and blankets">
            <label for="item5">Extra clothing and blankets</label> <br>

            <p> Without power, the nights may be cold. Keeping extra blankets and clothes will help you stay warm.</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="item6" name="item6" value="Medications and medical supplies">
            <label for="item6">Medications and medical supplies</label><br>

            <p> if anyone in your family requires medication, you should keep an emergency stash in case of an
                emergency.
                You also need to keep Tylenol and Advil in this kit</p>
            <input type="checkbox" id="item7" name="item7" value="Family emergency plan">
            <label for="item7">Family emergency plan</label><br>

            <p> If you and your family get seperated during a disaster, it is essential to have an emergency plan and a
                place to meet in case you get seperated.</p>


            <input type="checkbox" id="item8" name="item8" value="Learn evacuation routes and shelter locations">
            <label for="item8">Learn evacuation routes and shelter locations</label><br>

            <p>During an emergency, the safest option might not be to hunker down, but to evacuate the area. Knowing
                emergency routes or safer shelter locations is crucial to surviving a disaster</p>


            <input type="checkbox" id="item9" name="item9" value="Cash and important documents">
            <label for="item9">Cash and important documents</label>

            <p> Since the power will most likely be out, many places will not be able to take debit or credit cards.
                Having
                emergency cash will allow you to make purchases for whatever you need</p>
