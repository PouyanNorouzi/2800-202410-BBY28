        <h2>What is a Tornado</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the Earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Thunderstorms: Tornadoes often develop from severe thunderstorms, particularly those known as supercells, where rotating updrafts are present.</li>
                <li>Atmospheric Instability: When warm, moist air collides with cool, dry air, it creates the atmospheric instability necessary for tornado formation.</li>
