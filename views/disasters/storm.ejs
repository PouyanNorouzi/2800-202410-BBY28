        <h2>What is a Storm</h2>
    </div>

    <div class=content>
        <p>A storm is a violent atmospheric disturbance characterized by strong winds,
            heavy rain, thunder, lightning, and sometimes hail or snow. Storms can be 
            caused by various meteorological factors such as low-pressure systems, 
            tropical cyclones, or cold fronts. These weather phenomena can travel across
             vast regions, causing significant damage to infrastructure and natural landscapes.
              The average wind speed in a storm can reach 70 mph, with some of the most 
              powerful storms, like hurricanes, producing winds exceeding 150 mph. One of 
              the most destructive storms on record was Hurricane Patricia in 2015, with 
              sustained winds of 215 mph. The term "storm" comes from the Old English word "storm," meaning "tempest" or "violent weather."</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Atmospheric Pressure Changes</b></li>
        <p>One common cause of storms is rapid changes in atmospheric pressure, often associated with the development of low-pressure systems. When the atmospheric pressure drops rapidly, it can create strong winds and turbulent weather conditions, leading to the formation of storms.</p>
        <li><b>Warm Ocean Waters</b></li>
        <p>Warm ocean waters are a major cause of tropical storms and hurricanes. When ocean temperatures rise, they provide the energy needed for these powerful storms to develop. The warm water heats the air above it, causing it to rise and create a low-pressure area that can lead to storm formation.</p>
        <li><b>Cold Fronts</b></li>
        <p>Although less common than the other causes, the arrival of a cold front can lead to severe storms. When a cold air mass moves into an area of warm, moist air, it can cause the warm air to rise rapidly. This can result in the development of strong winds, heavy rain, and thunderstorm activity as the two air masses interact.</p>

        <h2>What to do in the event</h2>
    </div>

    <div class=content>
        <p><b>Immediate Action: </b>If you notice severe weather warnings or see dark, ominous 
            clouds approaching, don't wait for an official alert. Seek shelter indoors immediately.
             If you are outside and can't find shelter, avoid open fields, hilltops, and tall, 
             isolated trees that attract lightning.</p>
    
        <p><b>Seek Safe Shelter: </b> The safest place during a storm is indoors, 
            away from windows and exterior doors. If you are in a multi-story building,
             go to the lowest level or an interior room without windows, such as a 
             bathroom or closet. Avoid using electrical appliances and plumbing, as 
             lightning can travel through these systems.</p>
    
        <p> <b>Areas to avoid: </b> Avoid open spaces, bodies of water, and tall structures.
             Do not take shelter under trees, as they can attract lightning and fall due to 
             strong winds. Stay away from metal objects that can conduct electricity, such as 
             fences, poles, and bikes.  </p>
    
        <p><b>After the Storm: </b> After the storm passes, wait for official confirmation that
             it is safe to leave your shelter. Be aware of hazards such as downed power lines, 
             debris, and floodwaters. Avoid driving through flooded areas. Continue to monitor 
             weather updates and follow instructions from local authorities for safety 
             information and emergency services.</p>
